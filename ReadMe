Simon game is an electronic game of lights and sounds in which players must repeat random sequences of lights 
by pressing the colored pads in the correct order.
If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex.
Players get to watch, remember and repeat the exact sequence they saw.
Once the user fails the game is over.
